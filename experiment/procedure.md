2 	If the thermal cycler is not fitted with a heated lid, overlay the reaction mixtures with 1 drop (approx. 50 μl) of light mineral oil. Alternatively, place a bead of wax into the tube if using a hot start protocol. Place the tubes or the micro titer plate in the thermal cycler. Amplify the nucleic acids using the denaturation, annealing, and polymerization times at specified temperature.

3.	Withdraw a sample (5-10 μl) from the test reaction mixture and the four control reactions, analyze them by electrophoresis through an agarose gel, and stain the gel with ethidium bromide or SYBR Gold to visualize the DNA.

4.	A successful amplification reaction should yield a readily visible DNA fragment of the expected size. The identity of the band can be confirmed by DNA sequencing, Southern hybridization and/or restriction mapping.
 
 
### Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:
 
#### Materials Required:
 
1.	Agarose powder
2.	Ethidium bromide
3.	Electrophoresis buffer
4.	DNA samples
5.	DNA Ladders
6.	Gel casting trays
7.	Transilluminator
 
#### Procedure:
 
1.	Prepare a 50x stock solution of TAE buffer in 1000m of distilled H2O:
2.	Prepare sufficient electrophoresis buffer (usually 1x TAE ) to fill the electrophoresis tank and to cast the gel.
3.	Prepare a solution of agarose.
4.	When the molten gel has cooled, add 0.5µg/ml of ethidium bromide. Mix the gel solution thoroughly by gentle swirling.
5.	While the agarose solution is cooling, choose an appropriate comb for forming the sample slots in the gel. Pour the warm agarose solution into the mold.
6.	Allow the gel to set completely (30-45 minutes at room temperature), then pour a small amount of electrophoresis buffer on the top of the gel, and carefully remove the comb. Pour off the electrophoresis buffer. Mount the gel in the electrophoresis tank.
7.	Add just enough electrophoresis buffers to cover the gel to a depth of approx. 1mm.
8.	Mix the samples of DNA with 0.20 volumes of the desired 6x gel-loading buffer. Slowly load the sample mixture into the slots of the submerged gel using a disposable micropipette or an automatic micropipette or a drawn-out Pasteur pipette or a glass capillary tube. Load size standards into slots on both the right and left sides of the gel.
9.	Close the lid of the gel tank and attach the electrical leads so that the DNA will migrate toward the positive anode (red lead). Apply a voltage of 1-5 V/cm (measured as the distance between the positive and negative electrodes). If the electrodes are 10cm apart then run the gel at 50V. It is fine to run the gel slower than this but do not run it any faster. Above 5V/cm the agarose may heat up and begin to melt with disastrous effects on your gel's resolution. If the leads have been attached correctly, bubbles should be generated at the anode and cathode.
10.	Run the gel until the bromophenol blue and xylenecyanol FF have migrated an appropriate distance through the gel.
